create the node app as it is and then in the main server folder inside which you have the node app make a file named -> "Dockerfile"

now we will write configurations inside this Dockerfile for our project ->
# we will start by specifying the base image's operating system which we kept as ubuntu
FROM ubuntu
# then for this base image we need to install node on it 
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y curl
RUN curl -sl https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | bash -
RUN apt-get upgrade -y    
RUN apt-get install -y nodejs

# we copy of the necessary files to be kept in the docker image
COPY package.json package.json
COPY package-lock.json package-lock.json
COPY index.js index.js

# we specify the run command 
RUN npm install 

# we specify the entry point
ENTRYPOINT [ "node" , "index.js" ]



# now to create the image we run the command -> docker build -t aditya-firstNodejs-docker-app .
(This dot means that my file exists in this folder only)


[point to be noted is till now this image is not on docker.io but only in our local file system so we can only use it inside our system]

to run into our system locally => 
open cmd  init -> docker run -it aditya-firstnodejs-docker-app 
This will open run the image locally but still we need to expose the docker port to our local port
